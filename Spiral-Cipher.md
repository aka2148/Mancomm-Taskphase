# Spiral Cipher 

## Challenge

Ciphertext:
taskphaWL_PL4sOingpYefdngaP{_diddL40ap}y5rn_s1m37

## Solution
The challenge uses a **Spiral Cipher**, which typically works as follows:

- Write the ciphertext into a rectangular or square grid, row-wise.  
-  Read the grid in a **spiral order** (clockwise or counterclockwise) to reveal the plaintext.  

  Ciphertext has 49 characters so 7x7 grid  

Just give it to dcode and you get the answer
